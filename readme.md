## Eddy tracking Algorithm
The goal of this work is to study the mixing properties of the upper layer of the ocean. Using gliders data, we want to understand how eddy (coherent mesoscale features) affect the mixing of the oceanic upper layer.
The main objective is build a realiable eddy tracking algorithm that can detect and track the eddies over time. This would allow us to detect if the glider is crossing the path of an eddy.

The algorithm is based on D.B. Chelton's paper: "Global observations of nonlinear mesoscale eddies" from 2011.
